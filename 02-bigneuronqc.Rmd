This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

```{r, message=FALSE}
# you need to install the development version of the nat package
# devtools::install_github("jefferis/nat")
# the other package can come from CRAN
library(nat)
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)
library(igraph)
```

Read in the csv file generated by 01-findswcs.Rmd script
```{r}
swcdf=read.csv("swcdf.csv", as.is = c("path", "file"))
```


Read in all `r nrow(swcdf)` neurons as ngraph objects. This takes about 2.5 
minutes on my machine.

```{r}
swcng=read.neurons(swcdf$path, class='ngraph')
```

Now we can calculate some simple graph properties using the igraph library

```{r}
library(igraph)
swcdf$hascycles=!sapply(swcng, is_dag)
swcdf$subtrees=sapply(swcng, count_components)
# maximum node degree i.e. the total number of neighbours – a typical bifurcation would have 3.
swcdf$maxdegree=sapply(swcng, function(g) max(degree(g, mode = 'all')))
```

Now we can save a new csv file with those additional stats

```{r}
write.csv(swcdf, file='swcdf2.csv', row.names = FALSE)
```


## Summary tables
nb kable formats as a pretty table.

### Number of subtrees
```{r}
swcdf %>% 
  group_by(tool) %>% 
  summarise_each(funs(min, median, max), subtrees) %>%
  kable
```

### Node degree
Maximum node degree i.e. the total number of neighbours – a typical bifurcation would have 3.

```{r}
swcdf %>% 
  group_by(tool) %>% 
  summarise_each(funs(min, median, max), maxdegree) %>%
  kable
```
